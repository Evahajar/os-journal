## 🖥️ 1. System Architecture Diagram

![System Architecture Diagram](images/diagram.png)

The project uses a **small virtualised environment** built on my Windows laptop.  
The setup consists of:

- **One server VM**: Ubuntu Server 24.04.3 LTS  
- **One workstation VM**: Debian 13 (Trixie)

Both virtual machines run inside **VirtualBox** using **Bridged Networking**, allowing them to obtain real LAN IP addresses from the router and communicate as if they were physical devices on the same network.

---

### 📐 Architecture Overview

#### 🧑‍💻 Host Machine (Windows Laptop)
- Runs Oracle VirtualBox  
- Manages both virtual machines  
- Connected to the local LAN (e.g. `192.168.1.x`)

#### 🗄️ Server VM – Ubuntu Server 24.04.3 LTS
- **IP Address:** `192.168.1.221`
- **Installed services:**
  - OpenSSH  
  - Apache2  
  - UFW Firewall  
  - Fail2Ban  
  - AppArmor  
- Runs in **headless mode** (no desktop environment)

#### 💻 Workstation VM – Debian 13 (Trixie)
- **IP Address:** `192.168.1.183`
- Used to compare distributions and test connectivity  
- Lightweight GUI for ease of use

## 📦 2. Distribution Selection & Justification

For the server environment, **Ubuntu Server 24.04.3 LTS** was selected based on its **stability, security features, and documentation quality**, as well as its widespread use in industry and cloud platforms.

To justify this choice, Ubuntu Server was compared with **Debian**, which was installed as the workstation VM.

---

### ✅ Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS – Rationale
- Long-Term Support (5 years + extended security maintenance)
- Large package repositories and strong community documentation
- Beginner-friendly while still used professionally
- Secure defaults:
  - UFW firewall  
  - AppArmor  
  - Unattended security updates
- Suitable for learning real-world server administration

---

### 🔁 Debian 13 (Trixie) – Alternative Distribution
Debian is known for:
- Exceptional stability  
- Conservative software updates  
- Strong reliability in enterprise systems  
- Fully community-driven development

---

### 📊 Distribution Comparison

| Feature            | Ubuntu Server           | Debian                    |
|--------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| Release Cycle      | Regular LTS releases    | Slow, stability-first     |
| Default Security   | UFW + AppArmor          | Manual configuration      |
| Package Versions   | Newer and up to date    | Older but very stable     |
| Support            | Canonical + community   | Community-based only      |
| Learning Curve     | Easier for beginners    | More manual setup         |

---

### 🧠 Conclusion
Ubuntu Server was better suited for this coursework due to its **faster setup**, **secure defaults**, and **accessible documentation**. Debian remains an excellent choice for workstation use, but Ubuntu provides a smoother experience for server-focused tasks.

---

## 🧩 3. Workstation Configuration Decision

The workstation VM uses **Debian 13 (Trixie)** for the following reasons:

- Lightweight GUI and low resource usage  
- High compatibility with VirtualBox  
- Stable and predictable behaviour  
- Effective client system when connecting to Ubuntu Server  
- Enables comparison between two major Linux distributions (Debian vs Ubuntu)

Debian provides a clean environment for running Linux commands, testing networking, and analysing logs without unnecessary overhead.

---

## 🌐 4. Network Configuration Documentation

Both virtual machines use **Bridged Adapter mode** in VirtualBox.

This allows:
- Each VM to appear as a separate device on the local network  
- Automatic IP assignment via DHCP  
- Realistic server–client communication

---

### 🔧 Purpose of Bridged Networking
- SSH access from host to server  
- Testing web services via browser  
- Simulating a real-world network environment

---

### 🖧 Ubuntu Server Network Output (`ip addr`)

![Ubuntu IP](./images/ip.png)

**Observed:**
- Interface: `enp0s3`  
- IPv4 Address: `192.168.1.221`  
- Confirms bridged networking is active

---

### 🖧 Debian Workstation Network Output (`ip addr`)

![Debian IP](./images/ip1.png)

**Observed:**
- IPv4 Address: `192.168.1.183`  
- Same subnet as the server VM  

This confirms both systems are correctly configured for coursework tasks.

---

## 🧪 5. System Specifications Using CLI (Verification Evidence)

System verification was completed using the required command-line tools.

---

### 🧠 Kernel & Architecture
```bash
uname -a
````

![uname output](./images/sysinfo.png)

Confirms a **64-bit Linux kernel** running on `x86_64` architecture.

---

### 🧮 Memory Usage

```bash
free -h
```

![Memory Usage](./images/memoryusage.png)

* Total RAM: ~1.9 GB
* Used: ~347 MB
* Swap: Disabled

This confirms the system is lightweight and efficient.

---

### 💾 Disk Usage

```bash
df -h
```

![Disk Usage](./images/diskusage.png)

* Total Disk: 25 GB
* Used: ~12%
* Free: ~21 GB

---

### 🌐 Network Configuration

```bash
ip addr
```

![IP address](./images/ip.png)

Confirms the bridged interface and IPv4 address `192.168.1.221`.

---

### 🏷️ Operating System Verification

```bash
lsb_release -a
```

![OS Release](./images/osrelease.png)

Confirms **Ubuntu Server 24.04.3 LTS (Noble)**.

---

## 💻 Debian Workstation – System Specifications

### Kernel

```bash
uname -a
```

## 🪞 Reflection

This week involved building a **complete virtual environment from scratch** and understanding the differences between **server and workstation Linux distributions**.
Configuring two different systems enabled direct comparison and highlighted how design choices, such as update frequency and security defaults, influence real-world server administration.
